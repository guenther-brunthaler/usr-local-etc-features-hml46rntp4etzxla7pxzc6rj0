pxelinux primary HELP page (F1):

Get more help pages by pressing other function keys.

If function keys do not work, press [Ctrl]+[f],[2] for the same
effect as pressing [F2]. If that does not work either, type the
command

cat f2

into the pxelinux command line and press [Enter]. The "cat"
command displays text files. Other text files you might want
to show the same way:

help
dir
cwd.txt
f1
f3
