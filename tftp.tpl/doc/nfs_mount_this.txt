How to NFS-mount this filesystem
================================
v2023.155

$ mount -t nfs4 $SERVER:/srv/tftp /mnt

where $SERVER is either the DNS name or the IP address of the 
machine on which THIS file (you are reading right now) resides.


How has it been NFS-exported?
-----------------------------

NOTE: This is additional information. It is not needed to mount 
the network filesystem via NFS on the client machine.

The /etc/exports (chmod 644) on the server contains the line

/srv/tftp 10.0.0.0/8(all_squash,ro,subtree_check)
