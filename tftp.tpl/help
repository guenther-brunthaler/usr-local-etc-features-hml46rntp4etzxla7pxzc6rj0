HELP text for tftp:

The script refresh-dir-listings.sh on the tftp-server has been run to create a
file ./dir in every directory, containing the output of "ls -F" for the
directory contents.

File cwd.txt contains the absolute TFTP path to the TFTP server's home
directory.

Run "rosh" from the pxelinux prompt in order to get a simple shell which can
display those "dir" files and "cd" into subdirectories.

Important: In rosh, a "/" must always be appended to the name of a
subdirectory when using the "cd" command.
