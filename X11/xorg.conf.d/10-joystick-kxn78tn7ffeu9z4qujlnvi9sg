# Disable "Competition Pro" joystick from being used by default as a normal
# input pointer device. This is useful with game emulators such as VICE that
# get the input from the joystick directly, rather than the joystick
# controlling the X11 mouse cursor.
#
# Alternative to this Xorg snippet:
# $ CPRO=`xinput --list --id-only 'MOSIC      SPEED-LINK Competition Pro '`
# $ test "$CPRO" || echo 'Joystick not found!' >& 2
# $ xinput --set-prop $CPRO 'Generate Mouse Events' 0
# $ xinput --set-prop $CPRO 'Generate Key Events' 0
