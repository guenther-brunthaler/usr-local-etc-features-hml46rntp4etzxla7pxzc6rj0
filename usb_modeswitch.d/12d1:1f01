# HUAWEI E3372h-320

#
# Switch from 12d1:1f01 to 12d1:1001 (modem mode) rather than to 12d1:14db
# (web router mode).
#
# The reason: Web Router mode sends unsolicited traffic up to several MB per
# day for unknown reasons.
#
# In order to use this alternative modeswitch override, however one has to
# complete the setup wizard of the web router first and then disable the
# internet connection.
#
# This is a product ID of older HUAWEI modems and might have some functional
# disadvantages against the newer product ID below. But then, maybe not at all
# and it is all the same.

# This also works and switches to 12d1:155e. Try this as a fallback if the

# Unfortunately, as of at least kernel version 5.10.0-17, this mode creates
# not only a serial modem device needed for pppd, but also a CDC Ethernet
# device which is not needed for and even contradicts pppd operation.
