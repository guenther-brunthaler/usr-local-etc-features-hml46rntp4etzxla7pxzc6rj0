# Cron job for saving a RAM-based syslog to persistent storage.
#
# Saves those parts of a ring-buffer in RAM containing syslog-entries to
# permanent storage which have not been written there yet. Obviously, this
# script must be executed more frequently than the ring buffer needs time to
# fill completely, or some entries will be lost.
#
# The command which is used to read the current contents of the ring buffer
# can be specified via the /etc/default-mechanism. By default the command
# "logread" is used which dumps the ring buffer of busybox' syslogd
# implementation using the -C option.
#
# A different solution would be to use journald and instruct it to forward
# log-messages to the kernel message ring buffer. In this case, the
# "dmesg"-utility can be defined via /etc/default as the command for dumping
# the ring buffer.
#
# Note that the command for dumping the ring buffer will be passed to the
# shell, so it can actually be something more complex than a simple command,
# such as a whole pipeline of commands.
#
# The dump command can also be used to reformat and filter the log. Whatever
# is returned by the dump command will be considered the data to be made
# permanent. Just make sure the "transaction ID" log-messages created by this
# script do not get filtered out - they are needed for synchronization and
# ring-buffer overflow detection.
