README v2021.303

This directory contains git repository URLs and advice how to 
access them.

Usage of those additional repositories is completely optional.

At least this is the idea. Because it cannot be ruled out that 
some of the scripts in THIS repository might use some of the 
scripts from those other repositories accidentally and 
unintentionally. This should be considered a bug then.

Otherwise, the additional repositories may be used optionally to 
customize your system even further. They contain many useful 
scripts, primarily for system administration, but also for many 
day-to-day tasks.
