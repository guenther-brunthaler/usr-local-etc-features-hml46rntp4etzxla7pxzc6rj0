This is a maintenance directory for migrating changes.

It is *not* supposed to be copied over to a real /etc!

It just contains scripts and other documents for helping with synchronizing
the available changes between the etc/ and tpl/ directories, which is where5~
they are supposed to have been checked out from git (in a temporary common
base directory).
