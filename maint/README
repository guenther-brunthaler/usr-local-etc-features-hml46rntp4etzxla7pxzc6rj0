This is a maintenance directory for migrating changes.

It is *not* supposed to be copied over to a real /etc!

It just contains scripts and other documents for helping with synchronizing
the available changes between the /etc/ and /etc/$TPL_SYMLINK/ directories.

$TPL_SYMLINK is a symlink with an arbitrary name to where the repository
containing THIS file you are reading has been checked out. Alternatively,
you can also check the repository out there directly as a subdirectory
rather than using a symlink.

This might not be the best idea, however, because the etc-templates repository
might be much larger than /etc itself.

Scripts contained in /etc/$TPL_SYMLINK/maint are not meant to be part of the
files copied to /etc, but rather contains scripts for helping the
administrator perform the synchronization.
