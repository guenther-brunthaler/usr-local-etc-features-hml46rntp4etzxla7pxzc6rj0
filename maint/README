This is a maintenance directory for migrating changes.

It is *not* supposed to be copied over to a real /etc!

It just contains scripts and other documents for helping with synchronizing 
the available changes between the /etc/ and /etc/$TPL_SYMLINK/ directories.

$TPL_SYMLINK is a symlink with an arbitrary name to where the repository 
containing THIS file you are reading has been checked out. Alternatively, you 
can also check the repository out there directly as a subdirectory rather than 
using a symlink.

This might not be the best idea, however, because the etc-templates repository 
might be much larger than /etc itself.

Scripts contained in /etc/$TPL_SYMLINK/maint are not meant to be part of the 
files copied to /etc, but rather contains scripts for helping the 
administrator perform the synchronization.


Short explanations what the various scripts do
----------------------------------------------

Look into the comments at the start of every script in order to get more 
detailed usage instructions.

* ./diffs.sh: Show changes between the real /etc and its template version. 
Irrelevant changes should be identified and be added to local ignore lists, so 
they won't show up again in future runs of this script.

* ./external/*: Information about other external repositories 
which might be useful for system customization. Completely 
optional. Should not be needed at all. (Otherwise it should be 
considered a bug.)

* ./newlocals.sh: Display new files in the template directory which might thus 
be candidates for copying over to the real /etc. New files which are not 
wanted there should be added to the local ignore lists, so they won't show up 
again in future runs of this script.

* ./suggest-appliable-patches.sh: Compares all files which are not locally 
ignored and exist both in the template directory and the real /etc. Then emit 
a single update patch which would update all non-ignored files in /etc in such 
a way that they, after applying any locally defined patches, become identical 
to the template versions.

* ./unverified/*: Scripts which need more work or have not yet been tested 
properly. WIP.

* ./upstreams.sh: Find any new unmodified upstream copies in the template 
directory for files which do exist in the real /etc. They can then be copied 
over to the real /etc and both versions be put under version control. This 
allows to see which changes originated from upstream and which changes 
orinated locally.
