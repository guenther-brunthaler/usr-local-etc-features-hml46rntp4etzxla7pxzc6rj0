# The config snippets in this directory are intended to be read in an
# arbitrary order.
# 
# There are no dependencies between snippets. Any dependent options (regarding
# order) should be put into the same file, keeping the required order locally.
# 
# And this fact should be documented at the beginning of the snippet!
# 
# Unless there is a specific reason to group entries within a snippet, all
# lines should be sorted in lexicographical order. (This excludes possible
# comment blocks at the beginning of the files which always stay there.)
# 
# If subgroups are used within a snippet, the same applies to each subgroup.
# 
# Exceptions from this default should be documented at the beginning of the
# snippet.
