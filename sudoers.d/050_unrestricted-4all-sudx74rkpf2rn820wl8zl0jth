# v2026.34
#
# Allow every user to run any command as any user without
# entering a password.
#
# Use it only in a tightly controlled environment (e.g. a
# dedicated build/test system). In production it is a huge
# security hole.
#
# Only root may edit this file. It must be `chmod 0440`.
#
# Syntax:
# <user> <host> = ( <user> ) <options>: <commands>
#
# Example:
# ALL ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#
# Explanation:
#   * ALL       - every system user
#   * ALL       - on all hosts (here only locally)
#   * (ALL)     - may run the command as any user
#   * NOPASSWD: - do not prompt for a password
#   * ALL       - all commands

ALL ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
