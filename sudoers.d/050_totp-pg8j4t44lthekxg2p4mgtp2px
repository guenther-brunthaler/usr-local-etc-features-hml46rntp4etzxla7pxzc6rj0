# v2026.38
#
# Support for TOTP-logins with Google Authenticator PAM module.
#
# Makes PAM ask for the target account's TOTP "verification code" by default.
#
# Unfortunately, this also means that if TOTP is not working and PAM falls
# back to asking for a password, the target account's password will be
# expected, not the password of the invoking user.

Defaults targetpw
