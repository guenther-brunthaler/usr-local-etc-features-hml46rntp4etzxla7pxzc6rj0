DVTM-EDITOR(1)            BSD General Commands Manual           DVTM-EDITOR(1)

NAME
     dvtm-editor — make a text editor act as a filter

SYNOPSIS
     dvtm-editor ARGS...

DESCRIPTION
     The dvtm-editor is a file buffering utility used by the dvtm(1) terminal
     multiplexer to implement its copy mode. It reads the standard input and
     saves it to a temporary file, then opens an editor according to the
     ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

     If the invoked editor terminates with a non-zero exit status or the file
     modification time remains unchanged, dvtm-editor does not output any‐
     thing.  Otherwise, it outputs the content of the modified temporary file
     to stdout.

     All command line arguments are forwarded verbatim.  dvtm(1) uses this to
     adjust the initial view port by passing +n, meaning the start of line n
     should be displayed.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     dvtm-editor will try to find the user editor by checking these variables
     in order:

     DVTM_EDITOR
             Permitting to invoke an editor specific to dvtm, or set particu‐
             lar flags.

     VISUAL, EDITOR
             Falling back to global defaults: VISUAL and EDITOR.

     If no editor is found, vi(1) is used.

FILES
     The temporary files are created according to the template:
     /tmp/dvtm-editor.XXXXXX.

     /dev/tty is opened to obtain a controlling tty which is used for the
     standard input/output streams of the invoked editor.

NOTES
     Using vis(1) as editor is particularly convenient because :wq! in visual
     mode will reduce the file to the currently active selection(s).
