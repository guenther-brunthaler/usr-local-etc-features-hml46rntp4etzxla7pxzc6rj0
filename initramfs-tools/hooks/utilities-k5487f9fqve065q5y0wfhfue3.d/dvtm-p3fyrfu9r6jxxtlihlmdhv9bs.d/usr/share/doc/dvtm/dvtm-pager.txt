DVTM-PAGER(1)             BSD General Commands Manual            DVTM-PAGER(1)

NAME
     dvtm-pager — select appropriate pager for dvtm

SYNOPSIS
     dvtm-pager ARGS...

DESCRIPTION
     dvtm-pager is an utility used by the dvtm(1) terminal multiplexer to dis‐
     play its scrollback history using a suitable pager.

     The invoked pager is expected to display the data sent to its standard
     input.  The data stream might contain ANSI color escape sequence.  All
     command line arguments are forwarded verbatim.  dvtm(1) uses this to ad‐
     just the initial view port by passing +n, meaning the start of line n
     should be displayed.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     dvtm-pager will try to find the preferred pager by checking these vari‐
     ables in order:

     DVTM_PAGER
             Permitting to invoke a pager specific to dvtm, or set particular
             flags such as -R for less(1).

     PAGER   Falling back to the default pager.

     If none of these variables are set, less(1) is used.
