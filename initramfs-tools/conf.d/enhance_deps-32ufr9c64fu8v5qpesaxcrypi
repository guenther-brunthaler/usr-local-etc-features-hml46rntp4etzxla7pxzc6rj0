# Create a more powerful version of get_prereq_pairs() which is used by the
# initramfs framework to interpret the tokens returned by the "prereq" action
# of hook and boot scripts.
#
# Extend the syntax of supported "prereqs" tokens printed by some script as
# follows:
#
# somename - run the script AFTER any script "somename" (the old behaviour)
# <somename - run the script BEFORE any script "somename"
#
# Note: Be sure to properly quote "<" in the script, or it will be
# mis-interpreted by the shell as a redirection operator.

unset -f get_prereq_pairs

# Important: Keep this in sync with any changes in the function of the same
# name in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions!
#
# The function below should be the same code as there, except that the
# innermost "echo" has been enclosed within a new "if" and been moved into its
# "else" branch.
