# NEED_PERSISTENT_NET has been set to "yes".

# This file will also be automatically updated by some system-provided udev
# rule, adding rules for newly detected networking devices to the end of the
# file. "Newly detected" means there is not already a rule for matching its
# MAC address present.

# The lines of this comment block including the empty line after it have

# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single
# line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.
