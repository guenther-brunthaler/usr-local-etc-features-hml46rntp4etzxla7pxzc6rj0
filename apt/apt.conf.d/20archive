# We don't want to keep the archives twice, so delete as much as

#  - Set maximum allowed age of a cache package file. If a cache
#    package file is older it is deleted (0=disable)
#
#    The only reason whe a package should ever be deleted is
#    because it is outdated, but never because it is just too old.
APT::Periodic::MaxAge "0";

#  - Set minimum age of a package file. If a file is younger it
#    will not be deleted (0=disable). Useful to prevent races and
#    to keep backups of the packages for emergency.
#
#    The selected value reflects the minimum guaranteed lifetime
#    of debdeltas in the cache, so we can use the old files to
#    apply debdeltas for constructing new versions of those
#    files.
APT::Periodic::MinAge "10";

#  - Set maximum size of the cache in MB (0=disable). If the
#    cache is bigger, cached package files are deleted until the
#    size requirement is met (the biggest packages will be
#    deleted first).
